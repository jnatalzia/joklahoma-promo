This is a website developed to be used alongside an ad run in late november.

## Setup ##
 * Run `npm install` from your terminal to install required dependancies
 * Run `grunt` from the command line to build the site and then continually watch for changes

_Note:_ livereload is enabled for the watch task so either go [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei/) to install the chrome plugin to support it or check out the `grunt-contrib-watch` docs for information on inserting a script tag in the page.
